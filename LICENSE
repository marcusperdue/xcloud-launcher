Let me know if you'd like to include:

- Badge shields (build, license, stars, etc.)
- A GIF or screenshot of the UI in action
- Direct `.dmg` or `.AppImage` download links

Once added, save this as `README.md` in your root project folder and run:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README"
git push origin main
